# 3H_Leu_BactProd
Suite of scripts for evaluating, calculating, and plotting rates of marine bacterial production using liquid scintillation counter data from the 3H-leucine microcentrifuge method. Includes:

1. [plotQuenched.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/plotQuenched.m): Run this script first. Obtains best-fit parameters for a cubic function [quenchcurve_cubicfitfunc.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/quenchcurve_cubicfitfunc.m) for conversion of _H-number_ and _cpm_ to _dpm_, based on liquid scintillation counter efficiency. The function coefficients are written to an output file Quench_curve_fit_params.txt, which are then reimported by [riBPdata.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/riBPdata.m) for use in rate calculations. plotQuenched.m allows the user to control the manner in which dpm values are calculated, rather than rely on the LSC's own internal calculation routine. With [plotQuenched.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/plotQuenched.m):
   * [quenchcurve_cubicfitfunc.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/quenchcurve_cubicfitfunc.m): A cubic function required by [plotQuenched.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/plotQuenched.m).
   * [Quench_standards_20130924.xlsx](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/dependencies/Quench_standards_20130924.xlsx): Example quench standard data from a liquid scintillation counter; you will want to run standards on your LSC and upload the data to a similar file.
   * [Quench_curve_fit_params.txt](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/Quench_curve_fit_params.txt): An example output file from [plotQuenched.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/plotQuenched.m), containing best-fit parameters. This file is parsed by [riBPdata.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/riBPdata.m).

5. [riBPdata.m](https://github.com/jamesrco/3H_Leu_BactProd/blob/master/riBPdata.m): The centrl
